## create a platform that simplifies the complex task of choosing the right laptop

Ever found it confusing that which brand of laptop should be preferred and which model should be bought that would cater to our needs?

Yes we all do!!

So we've tried providing a solution for this problem through our application- Laptop Lens.It provides information regarding trending laptop brands and models,a comparative analysis of features and prices,an informative guide for users highlighting things to be checked for ensuring the right selection and purchase of the laptop.

Various java features utilised in designing applications are Javafx,JDBC,Oops,Exception handling and Packages.

The application has been developed under guidance of Shashi Bagal sir and Core2web team.And I would like to extend my gratitude for their consistent efforts and support without which we would not have been able to successfully complete our project.
